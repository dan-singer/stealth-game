# Trealthy
Trealthy is a first-person stealth adventure game set in a dark, haunted forest inspired by *The Empress Card* from *Tarot*.
Your goal is to eradicate pollution in a forest. The Empress is the only one who can save the forest, but you have to collect and combine the 6 fragmented pieces of the card to summon her. You must sneak your way through the forest, avoid the pollution gas, and collect the fragmented *Empress* cards. You're also equipped with a nature gun, capable of spawning bushes that can be used as cover from the pollution if crouched in.
